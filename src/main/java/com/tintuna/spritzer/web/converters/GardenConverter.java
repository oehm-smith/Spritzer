 * I couldn't make this a @FacesConverter as I want to @Inject the logger.
 * Thus require it to be a ManagedBean though chose a CDI Bean (MBs are managed by JSF, whereas CDI bean managed 
 * by Application Server.
 * 
 * If I'd made it a @FacesConverter I could have used the value of '(forClass = Garden.class)' so it is automagically
 * wired to Convert for that class.  Now I need to explicitly include in the JSF element (eg. '<h:selectOneMenu ..>')
 * the 'converter' attribute or '<f:converter ..>' element.
 * 
 * JSF 2.2 will make FacesConverters CDI Managed objects and I wouldn't have to do any of this.
